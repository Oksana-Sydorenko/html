        <h1><strong> To respect their point of view</strong></h1>
        <p> We strongly believe that “pet" is not the right word to describe the relationship we envision between humans and cats and dogs. Our solidarity projects, and our philosophy to look at the world through their eyes, tell us that we as humans have to realize what it really means to take care of a cat or a dog. Cats and dogs are not like toys that you can buy in a shop, keep for your own pleasure and leave in the corner, destroy or give away once you get bored or grow out of it. We shouldn't treat them like machines to “produce" puppies and kittens for human pleasure. Instead, we need to understand their nature, respect them and commit to them in every phase of their life.For us, the word, “pet," does not live up to the bond that is needed between humans and cats and dogs. The expression, “companion animal," in contrast, describes much better the partnership of mutual respect that we have in mind when we are talking about cats and dogs. Also, the European Council, as well as the European Commission that is working on a  European-wide registration for cats and dogs, is using the word, “companion animal,"  rather than “pets."</p>
